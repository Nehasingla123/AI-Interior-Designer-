                                                                          *AI-Interior-Designer*
This project, AI Interior Designer, is an intelligent voice-interactive system that assists users in redesigning their room interiors using AI. The entire process is driven by voice-to-voice communication, eliminating the need for manual typing or interaction.
Procedure:
1. Image Upload:
The user begins by uploading an image of their room through the web interface.
2. Voice Interaction Starts:
Once the image is uploaded, the system initiates a voice conversation with the user. The AI asks key questions like:
"What is your preferred interior design theme?"
"What is your budget for this redesign?"
3. User Responds via Voice:
The user replies using voice, and the AI continues the conversation, asking:
"What specific changes would you like to see in your room?"
"Would you like suggestions within your budget?"
4. AI Understanding & Processing:
The AI processes the user's responses using:
Gemini 2.0 Flash Preview Image Generation to redesign the uploaded room image.
Gemini 2.5 Native Audio Dialog for real-time speech-to-speech interaction.
Google Search Tools to suggest furniture, colors, or styles within the specified budget.
Image Output & Suggestions:
Based on the interaction, the AI modifies the original image and displays the redesigned version on the screen, fully personalized according to the userâ€™s voice inputs.
